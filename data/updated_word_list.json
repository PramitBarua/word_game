    "Notes": "The verb deride means to speak to someone with contempt or show a low opinion of someone or something. A bully might constantly deride other kids in his class \u2014 which might lead to many afternoons spent in the principal's office.\n\nTo \"ride\" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes from the Latin root d\u0113r\u012bd\u0113re, meaning \"to ridicule, to scorn,\" and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns.",

    "Notes": "Sure, to importune is to beg, but use it only when you're talking about going beyond mere begging into more urgent territory. The woman importuned the judge to release her innocent brother from jail.\n\nThe original Latin term actually meant something closer to \"to bother.\" Bear that in mind when you're deciding whether to use importune, because that's the kind of begging you'd want to be talking about when you do. Imagine needing something so badly that you cannot stop asking for it: then you might importune someone to get it. After a year of being importuned, dad let me have the car.",
